## Overview

The Project page is displayed when a project is selected from the top level page of the app.

The project page has tabs representing the following areas:

* **Scenes** - the scenes within the script
* **Characters** - the list of characters that had dialogue within the script
* **Locations** - the list of locations that were associated with each scene
* **Crew** - the crew that will be working on the project


## Scenes

When the Scenes tab is selected, it shows a list of the scenes within the script. Each entry shows the Scene number, the Location name (using the aliased name if appropriate), the Coverage (i.e. how much of the scene has been covered by a Set Up) and the percentage _Completed_ (i.e. how many of the Set Ups have had Takes recorded).

This image shows how the list of Scenes looks before any Set Ups or Takes have been defined:

When Set Ups have been defined, it will be reflected in the _Coverage_ percentage. Once Takes have then been associated with those Set Ups, the _Completed_ percentage will represent that fact.

The context menu for a Scene only includes one item currently:

### Send a Scene Report

Once a Scene has been completed, i.e. all appropriate Takes have been recorded for each Set Up, then a report can be sent to an editor to provide the information about all of the Takes.

This information can be a useful aid to help the editor identify which may be the best Takes for forus on, as the report includes information about the Set Ups and their coverage, as well as each Take with their optional comments and approvals.
