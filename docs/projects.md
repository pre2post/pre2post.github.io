## Create Project

To create a new project, select the "+" symbol in the bottom right hand corner of the top level Projects page. This will show the file explorer window. Select the approrpiate PDF file representing the script to be associated with the project.

![](/assets/images/projects-new-project.png)

If the name of the script can be extracted from the PDF file, then it will be pre-filled within the name field. Otherwise an appropriate name should be entered.

The dialog box also provides information about the number scenes that were extracted from the document. This should be verified to ensure the correct number have been located. If this is not correct, it is likely that the application has not been able to detect those scenes.

We are continually looking to improve the reliability of the application. If you identify a situation where not all scenes are correctly located, and feel it is an issue with the application rather than a formatting problem with the script, then please feel free to send the script (or a cut down version demonstrating the issue) to **bugs@pre2post.online** with an explanation of the problem.
