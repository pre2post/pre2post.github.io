Pre2Post is a mobile app (currently just for Android at the moment) that can be used to help with:

* Pre-production planning of scenes and their set-ups
* Evaluate scene coverage (by percentage and viewing a report)
* Documenting the Takes that are recorded per set-up
* Optionally using app to announce the Take and simulate the clapperboard
* Optionally capturing approvals (by areas of responsibility) and comments per Take
* Generating a Scene report that can be emailed to your Editor
