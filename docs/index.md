Pre2Post is a mobile app (currently just for Android) that can be used to help with:

* Pre-production **planning of scenes and their set-ups**
* Evaluation of **scene coverage** (by percentage and/or viewing a report)
* **Documenting the Takes** that are recorded per set-up (including date/time, duration and optional comment)
* Optionally using app to **announce the Take** and **simulate the clapperboard**
* Optionally **capturing approvals** (by areas of responsibility) per Take
* **Generating a Scene report** that can be emailed to your Editor

Pre2Post is currently a single-user application, and therefore does not enable multiple users to collaborate on the same project. Although this may be added in a
future versions, the application does enable projects to be exchanged between users.

### Project workflow

* Creating the project

The first step would be to create the project. This will most likely be the responsibility of the Producer or Director.

This is essentially achieved by bootstrapping a new project with a script contained in a PDF document. More information on how to do this is explained in [here](/docs/projects#create-project).


* Review the Characters and Locations (Optional)

When viewing the Characters and Locations tabs of the project page, you may find that some of the characters and/or locations have been spelt slightly differently in various positions in the script. Although this is not a big deal, you may want consistency.

The app enables 'aliases' to be establish, to allow an incorrect (or different) spelling of a character or location to reference the correct entry. See either [Character Alias](/docs/project#character-alias) or [Location Alias](/docs/project#location-alias) for more details.


* Define Crew (Optional)

The app can be used to [define the crew members](/docs/project#crew) on the project. This is optional, but can be useful when generating reports or identifying who has responsibility for approving a take.


* Plan the Set Ups

The next step is to [share the project](/docs/projects#share-project) with the Director of Photography to plan the set ups for each of the scenes.

The DoP will work through each of the scenes within the project to [create one or more set ups](/docs/scene#create).


* Document the Takes

In preparation for shoot day, the [project should be shared](/docs/projects#share-project) with the 2nd AC. They will be responsible for captuing the information about each take.


* Send the Editor a Scene Report

Finally, once a scene has been completed, the 2nd AC can [send a scene report](/docs/project#send-a-scene-report) to the editor so they have an overview of the information about each take.
