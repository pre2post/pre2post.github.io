The _Pre 2 Post_ app uses [GitHub](https://github.com/pre2post/community) to host a community site that is used to manage discussions and issues. This site is public, enabling other users of the app to see (and collaborate on) the discussions/issues. This is the preferred method of communication, as community involvement can improve longer term support for the project.


## Discussing ideas

If you would like to discuss areas (existing features or future enhancements) related to the app, then please take a look at the [Discussions](https://github.com/pre2post/community/discussions) area to see whether there is already an existing conversation underway that you can contribute to. If not, then feel free to create a new discussion topic.


## Reporting an issue

If you have found an issue with the app, and would like to report the issue along with information that may help to diagnose and reproduce the problem, then please open an issue.

If the app displays an error dialog, with a button for reporting the issue, then share the information via email sending to `bugs@pre2post.online`.

Otherwise, go to the [Issues](https://github.com/pre2post/community/issues) page and check whether the issue has previously been reported. If it has, then see whether you can provide additional information that may help to diagnose and reproduce the problem. If the issue has not previously been reported, then create a new issue with as much detail as possible to help identify the problem. Where possible, if you could share an example script that reproduces the problem - if privacy is an issue, then the script could be emailed to `bugs@pre2post.online` including a link to the created [issue](https://github.com/pre2post/community/issues).
